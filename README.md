Analysis of Malware Detection for Android applications using Machine Learning Techniques
1. A Cyber Security Project implemented using Machine Learning with Python.
2. Objective: To detect whether a given android application is malicious or benign, as knowing in advance that an application is dangerous allows to block it before it causes any harm.
3. Added Functionalities: Hyperparameter Tuning the SVM classifier - to improve the model's accuracy (Tunes 'c' and 'gamma' parameters)
4. A research paper-based implementation: Arp, Daniel & Spreitzenbarth, Michael & HÃ¼bner, Malte & Gascon, Hugo & Rieck, Konrad. (2014). DREBIN: Effective and Explainable Detection of Android Malware in Your Pocket.
